# growOxDNA

This is a framwork for growing staged patchy particle assemblies, adding additional particle types as the simulations grow. Please have a look at the different examples (octahedron, quadraped), as they should help get you started. The examples use the "Romano flavour" of patchy particles, but it should be easy to adapt to other patchy particle implementations (e.g. Rovigatti) by creating an `growPatchyRovigatti.py` script with a different `addToTop()` function.
